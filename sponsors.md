Founded in 2010, Startup Calgary is an entrepreneur-led, volunteer-driven grassroots movement with the mission to activate startups, connect founders and grow the local startup ecosystem. We do this by partnering with the best resources, both in and out of Calgary, to run fantastic events and programs. We are constantly thinking of new ways to cultivate our great tech community and collaborate with the enormous amount of (often hidden) talent here in Calgary. Reach out, grab a coffee with us and let us know how we can help you build and launch your startup.
