##Contracting

### Aaron Rustad([@aaronrustad](https://twitter.com/aaronrustad), arustad -at- anassina.com)

I'm looking for a solid developer that would be interested in a 3 - 6 month remote contract, with a possibility of extension.  My team is developing a web based video distribution and syndication platform/service for a large US media company. We're currently streaming upwards of 100 million high quality videos a month with the intention of reaching 250 million in 2015.

Technologies we're using in include Rails (of course), Redis, Elasticsearch, Ember.js, PostgreSQL, We're fully cloud deployed on AWS.

Our team is small and talented, consisting of myself and 3 other engineers and while our client is large, we're very much focused on delivering code in an developer-friendly manner. We love small features, continuous deployments and we ship to production several times a day (I think our record is 12 times) with zero downtime. This happens on our live site with upwards of 10,000 req/m. We're big fans of Github, code reviews, and Pull Requests which all tie directly into our deployment pipeline.

We communicate primarily via HipChat, and occasionally using Google Hangouts. We have two scheduled meetings a week, one lasting for ~ 10 minutes, the other about 30 mins. We're fans of coding, not meetings.  If this sounds like a good fit for you, or if you have any question, please contact me!
