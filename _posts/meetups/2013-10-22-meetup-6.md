![JSON](http://railscasts.com/static/episodes/stills/320-jbuilder.png)

When building JSON APIs for mobile apps, we find ourselves wanting a more expressive and powerful solution. This is especially true when the JSON representation is complex or doesn't match the exact schema defined within the database. In this presentation, we will demo not One, not Two but Three different ways of generating APIs in rails. We will demonstrate how to use RABL, Active Model Serializers and JBuilder, and highlight what we've learnt from each one of them.
