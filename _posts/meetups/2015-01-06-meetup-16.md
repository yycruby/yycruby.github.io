## Where Code Quality and Business Value Meet

We're starting off 2015 with something a bit different. This month we're pleased
to have a panel discussion with three leaders from Calgary businesses to discuss
the tradeoff between code quality and maintainability and value to the business.

Our panel consists of:

  * David Gluzman from [BlackSquare](http://blacksquare.ca)
  * Amit Utam from [PetroFeed](https://www.petrofeed.com)
  * Chris Reid from [Vogogo](https://www.vogogo.com)

We also have a survey to help us focus this year and learn from what everyone
liked from last year, you can answer as many questions as you like.
