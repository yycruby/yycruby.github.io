Lightning Talks are short talks given by anyone in the group. 300 seconds long max.

This is your chance to talk about whatever you want. 

Ruby, Rails, testing, your awesome company, a pet project... anything.

A couple examples to get you thinking:

[Gary Bernhardt - Using Your Type's Good](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/useing-youre-types-good)

[Lightning Talks - Part 1, Hosted by Dr. Nic Williams](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/useing-youre-types-good)

Post talks there will be hacking and chatting as always.

So come on out, and be heard. 

This Meetup is part of the Calgary Hack Night series, with the folks at Startup Calgary.
