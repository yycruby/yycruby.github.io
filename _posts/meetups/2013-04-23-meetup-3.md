Time to be come a Ruby warrior.

One of the best ways to learn any language is start to use it. At this meetup, lets get together and code. I don't want to give awy to much, but please bring you laptop with Ruby installed and ready to code.

There will be a short demo and then we will break into teams/pairs and do some collaborative coding. If you do not have a laptop or are worried about your experience with Ruby don't that is why we are going to pair up.

As always the meet up starts at 6:30 and goes until 7:30 but with all the fun planned we can strech that until 8:00 if we need to.
