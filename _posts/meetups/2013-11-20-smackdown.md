This Meetup is not a Meetup, it's a Smackdown... We're taking on the .Net guys who think their MVC Framework holds up and maybe better than Rails, our weapon of choice. 

Them's Fighting Words. 

We'll be talking about 5 core issues surrounding modern web-app development:

1) Hosting: Azure and Appharbor vs. Heroku and EngineYard

2) ORM: ActiveRecord vs. EF

3) Performance: Threading and the GIL

4) Cost

5) Editor Templating vs. Scaffolding

Unfortunately we only have time to talk about these topics, which is actually probably good news for them.

This Meetup is being co-hosted by Simon Timms([@stimms](http://twitter.com/stimms)) and the .NET user group so it will be a bigger than normal turnout I'm sure.

Looking forward to seeing everyone on the 20th!
