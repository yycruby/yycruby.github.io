Hey folks!

Last year we tried out Ruby Warrior, and in light of the fun had at the last RTanque competition we thought we would continue along with coding based activities.

The objective is to code a Warrior that navigates dungeons populated with obstacles, and monsters. 

Much like RTanque this is focused on fun, challenge based coding.

See you then!

Also checkout this web-app for testing your warrior code. It's awesome.
